As scientists, we spend most of our time asking, "What's next?" "What's new?"  We rarely spend enouth time looking backward to learn or appreciate how we got here in the first place.  In the field of targeted cancer therapy, Jessica Wapner's [Philadephia Chromosome](http://jessicawapner.com/the-philadelphia-chromosome/) offers us all a chance to look back, and to marvel at the astounding progress in cancer research over the just the past fifty years.

Ostensibly, the "Philadephia Chromosome" is about the development of Gleevec, the blockbuster drug developed by Novartis for treating Chronic myelogenous leukemia (CML).  As such, the book attempts to connect the scientific dots between the initial discovery of the Philadelphia Chromosome in CML patients in 1959 and the clinical development of Gleevec in the 1990s.  In doing so, it traces the full historical arc of modern cancer research:  the discovery of oncogenes by Bishop and Varmus, the identification of BCR/ABL as the fusion caused by the Philadelphia Chromosome, the discovery of protein kinases, the creation of cell lines, the development of kinase inhibitors, and even the development of resistance to targeted cancer therapies.  With thorough research and clear writing, Wapner traces each of these scientific threads, explaining how disparate fields of research combined to conquer CML.  In describing the early research on CML and cancer oncogenes, and in one of my favorite passages of the book, she writes:

	The way the Philadelphia chromosome led to CML was a story that unfolded like a hundred painters applying brushes to a canvas at some time or another over twenty five years... There'd been no final picture in mind and no awareness that they were event painting something together.  And yet, there it was.  A scientific masterpiece.
	
Wapner also provides a human face to the heros of CML, with particular attention to David Hungerford and Peter Nowell, who  in 1959 made the initial discovery of the Philadelphia Chromosome, and Janet Rowley, who discovered in 1973 that the Philadelpha Chromosome was in fact a translocation between chromosomes 9 and 22.  Particular attention is also payed to Brian Druker, Nicholas Lydon, Alex Matter, and Charles Sawyers, all of whom played  pivotal roles in the development of Gleevec or second generation CML drugs.  Druker receives the top-billing, though, and it's clear that patients and patient advocates believe that Druker is the true hero of Gleevec (originally called STI-571 in clinical trials, many patients were disappointed with the name Gleevec, and several even suggested it be renamed "Drukercillin").  Another patient praises Druker to no end, claiming that Druker is "right up there, right under God."

There are no really evil protaganists in this story.  Novartis receives some criticism for not moving quickly enough with clinical trials, and even greater criticism for the cost of Gleevec.  But, Wapner's treatment of Novartis is even-handed, and the company gets more than enough credit for bringing Gleevec to market in the first place.
