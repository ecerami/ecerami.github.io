After many years of struggling with R, I have now made the transition to Python for data analysis.  Python notebooks have also been a revelation, and there is no turning back now.

A few useful resources for those looking to take the plunge:

* <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/10min.html">10 Minutes to Pandas</a>:  Good introduction with basic code examples.

* <a ref="https://github.com/jvns/pandas-cookbook">Pandas Cookbook</a>:  Excellent introduction with sample Python notebooks you can work through yourself.  I especially enjoyed the notebooks for analyzing New York City 311 calls.

* Pandas, MatPlotLib, and Numpy <a href=" https://drive.google.com/folderview?id=0ByIrJAE4KMTtaGhRcXkxNHhmY2M">Cheat Sheets</a>:  Excellent, concise cheat sheets.  Print them out and keep them handy.

* <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org/pandas-docs/stable/">Official Pandas Docs</a>:  Not the easiest for beginners, but handy nonetheless.

* <a href="http://pandas.pydata.org">Whatâ€™s New in Pandas</a>:  New stuff appears here.

* <a href="http://matplotlib.org/">MatplotLib</a>:  Plotting in Python.  So much easier than R!

* <a href="http://stanford.edu/~mwaskom/software/seaborn/">Seaborn: statistical data visualization</a>:  For when MatPlotLib doesn't cut it.

* <a href="https://plot.ly/python">Plot.ly</a>:  now fully open source;  easily create interactive plots and visualization.

And, for those looking for a quick, simple mash up of pandas and plotly, served via flask, a basic hello world application:  <a href="https://github.com/ecerami/hello_flask">https://github.com/ecerami/hello_flask</a>.
