Six weeks ago, I realized that I really missed writing.

Writing used to consume many of my waking hours, and I always enjoyed every step of the process, from finding and evaluating topics, to creating sample code, and organizing research notes, to the actual writing and editing process.

I am not sure why it is usually so satisfying, but it is the single best way I know to deeply learn a topic, and to connect to a wider community.  

Put simply, to write is to think and to connect.

With the urge to write again, I have resurrected biobits.org, a site which I hope to devote to my main interests:  bioinformatics, scientific computing, and cancer genomics.  I originally set up biobits.org on blogger, but I never found the time to maintain it.  And, with the renewed interest in writing, I found my way to GitHub as a far better alternative for publishing the site.  

For a geek such as myself, GitHub is hands-down a better option than blogger.  Revision control, support for [markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), [jekyll configuration](http://jekyllrb.com/), and instant deployment.  It's also just a hell of a lot geekier and fun.

Here's to more writing.  Thanks, GitHub.
