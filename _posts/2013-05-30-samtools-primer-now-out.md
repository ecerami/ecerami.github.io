title: SAMtools Primer is now out
---

My tutorial, [SAMtools:  A Primer](samtools_primer.html) is now available online.  My hope is that the primer eases some of the "information pain" usually associated with learning next-generation sequence analysis.  To that end, the primer is completely self-contained â€” you only need to install SAMtools, and the tutorial section walks you through a complete next-generation sequence analysis work-flow.

Sample data sets are provided on the companion [github repository](https://github.com/ecerami/samtools_primer), and a short glossary is also included at the end of the document.

If you identify any errors or have suggestions for improving the primer, I would love to hear from you.  Just drop me an email at:  cerami AT gmail.com.

August, 2013 Update:  The Primer now has a new section where you can immediately post feedback and questions.  Thanks for all the feedback so far!
